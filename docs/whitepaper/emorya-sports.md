### Purchasing EMR
To use the app, users must purchase the **$EMR token** with their own funds. This will give them the option to "mine" the **$EMRS token**, which is valued at **30% of the $EMR token's market capitalization**. The amount of $EMRS awarded to each user is **proportional** to the number of calories they burn each day.

### Goals and Challenges
In addition to tracking daily activity, **Emorya** will offer **substantial prizes** for meeting established goals and completing challenges set by fitness instructors.
