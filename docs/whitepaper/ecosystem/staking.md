# Staking

Emorya utilizes the Elrond platform on which it is presently based (Elrond Smart Chain), both environmentally friendly and sustainable, and the proof-of-stake algorithm. In addition to being the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, Elrond also provides superior staking services. Elrond Staking assures the safety of user funds through the deployment of special security measures and the provision of a Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). At the time of writing, our staking method is undeniably one of the safest and most environmentally friendly passive income generation strategies with cryptocurrencies. For keeping track of all staked tokens, the platform employs a secure wallet and a process of double-checking.

As more people, particularly institutional investors, become aware of the potential profitability of the cryptocurrency market, Emorya is rapidly becoming a method for generating passive income by keeping or locking funds in a wallet.

Emorya staking systems are advantageous because they enable investors with minimal technical knowledge of cryptocurrencies to stake proof of stake (PoS) tokens and earn rewards. This is because staking cryptocurrencies involves specialized cryptographic knowledge and compliance criteria that are not always accessible to the general public.

Because the staking network equips you with the essential knowledge and abilities and the capacity to authenticate stakes, you can earn substantial returns on your investment with less time and effort. As a result of the exponential growth of bitcoin staking, staking platforms that enable investors to collect staking incentives have increased everywhere. This is the place to be if you are interested in passively earning Emorya Tokens through staking.
