# Liquidity

Emorya ensures that token holder purchases are held immediately for **liquidity**, with the primary goal of communicating success to stockholders and avoiding **whale declines**. The system is self-contained, and the objective is to provide owners with a facility that serves two purposes. 

Once a stable price has been established, the contractors collect tokens from sellers and deposit them into the Lp. This serves as a **fluctuation barrier**, guaranteeing that the owners' price remains stable. Additionally, it provides owners with a platform for **contingent costs** and prevents a **hyper-distribution** of token values if Whale intends to sell their tokens in the market, thereby maintaining price stability.
