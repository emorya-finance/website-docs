# dApp

A decentralized application, or **dApp**, is a software program that operates independently and utilizes **smart contracts** to run on a **decentralized** blockchain or other distributed ledger system. Like traditional applications, dApps provide users with various **functionalities and utilities**.

**Emorya Sport**, rewards users for healthy activities such as calorie-burning through its **hyper-deflationary** currency. A portion of Emorya's value is distributed directly to Emorya Sport's users for every transaction made. Users can access the transferred funds via the **MultiverseX** network by logging in through the **xPortal** extension or application. If users choose to connect through the xPortal application, they need to **return to the site** and **claim** their funds. Ten percent of the purchased coins will be visible in the **token section** of the xPortal Wallet, while the remaining 90 percent can be viewed in the **inquiry section**.
