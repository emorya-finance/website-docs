# Overview

Emorya is a **hyper-deflationary** platform with a **comprehensive** ecosystem built on the **MultiverseX** blockchain. It features two **key** tokens, $EMRS and $EMR, which **interact** with blockchain exchanges and transfers, providing a complete and **robust** offering. The Emorya ecosystem encompasses **NFTs**, **dApps**, **Liquidity**, **Burning**, and **Staking**.

As a deflationary cryptocurrency, the supply of Emorya will decrease over time, driving up its value as long as demand remains steady. This rapid decrease in the currency's value is referred to as **hyper deflation**. As a result, debts will become more severe as the real worth of goods and services increases while the currency's value decreases.
