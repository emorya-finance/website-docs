# ðŸ§© How it Works

As the world experiences an ongoing process of automation in **developed economies** like Japan and South Korea, it is **crucial** to adapt to the new practices and trends brought about by technological advancements. **Emorya** aims to provide financial independence to people all over the world by offering a **unique program**.

The **Emorya Sports App** tracks your daily caloric expenditure, and based on this, you will receive an $EMRS coin. This coin will be transferred to your wallet **once every 24 hours** through the app. You can convert the $EMRS to the $EMR hyper-deflationary currency by **swapping directly in the app**, with a **3% conversion fee**.

The $EMRS currency is valued at **30% of the $EMR token's market capitalization**. With every $EMR purchase, **30% of the transaction amount** is immediately transferred to the $EMRS token, **adding value to it**.

The $EMR hyper-deflation function redistributes **12% of the transaction amount**, where **50% of the Emorya team's funds** will be continuously invested back into the project to drive growth and adoption.
